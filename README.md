# Prompt Engineering Pipeline with Safety Filter and Image Generation

This project is a comprehensive pipeline developed during the **NNDL Hackathon**, aimed at enhancing user prompts, filtering out unsafe inputs, and generating images using diffusion models with style control through LoRA.

## 🚀 Features

- **Prompt Enhancer**: Improves prompt clarity and relevance using NLP techniques.
- **Dangerous Prompt Filter**: Identifies and blocks prompts that are unsafe or harmful using a classification model.
- **Image Generation Pipeline**: Leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality images from the cleaned and enhanced prompts.
- **Style Control with LoRA**: Fine-tunes the generated images to follow specific styles using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers & Diffusers
- LoRA for style transfer
- NLP models for prompt filtering (e.g., BERT/RoBERTa)
- Jupyter Notebooks
